# Basic Gradle Concepts

### Tasks
	definitions of build activities - can write your own. 

### Plugins
	provide tasks (gradle provides almost none).

### Dependencies
	libraries that the application depends on.
	E.g. JUnit, JSON etc.

### Repositories
	places where Gradle looks for required libraries.
	E.g. Maven Central as a repository

### Each time you build your project:
* All tests will be run
* Code compiled
* Exectuable jar file created
* Automates build process
* Leads to greater productivity
